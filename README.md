# Are you at the risk of a heart disease ?

If you are unsure, then this project is of your interest. Here I have trained a Random Forest model on a CDC survey [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) and made a web app using Flask and deployed it on [AWS](http://ec2-54-91-30-108.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/) where you could answer some questions about yourself and have the model predict whether you have a risk of heart disease or not.

I have also [provided](Analysis%and%modelling/analysis_mod.ipynb) the analysis and processing of the data, with a model building on the data using the evaluation metrics.
